# Melanoma Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks
## Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based approach for melanoma detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on skin cancer images to classify melanoma and non-melanoma cases.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of skin cancer images. Ensure the dataset is structured properly before training.

## Dependencies

Install the required libraries before running the project:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and classify images.

## Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone (repository-url)<br>
   cd (repository-folder)

2. Ensure the dataset is in the correct directory.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:<br>
   jupyter notebook deeplearningfinal.ipynb

## Results

The model evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
